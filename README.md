# Weather Dashboard

The goal is to create a weather dashboard where you search for a city and it will display the weather in that city and save the city to a search history. The weather needs to display an icon of the weather, humidity, tempature and wind speeds. The dashboard needs to show th enext five days and the current tempatures. When a search history city is selected then it'll display the weather from that city.

## The process

### What i did
* Used css an bootstrap to create a clean format
* Used the geo api to take the city and convert it to lat and lon
* Used the lat and lon to gather the weather infromation for the 5 day forcast and the current forcast
* Created elements using java to appear on the page that hold the weather information
* Created a click function that would make the functions display the weather for the information typed
* Created a loop that would generate a button from the citys put into local storage for the search history
