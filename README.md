# Weather Dashboard

The goal is to create a weather dashboard where you search for a city and it will display the weather in that city and save the city to a search history. The weather needs to display an icon of the weather, humidity, tempature and wind speeds. The dashboard needs to show th enext five days and the current tempatures. When a search history city is selected then it'll display the weather from that city.
